# Imgur.API-net40
Imgur.API-net40 is a .NET 4.0 forked version of [Damien Dennehy's Imgur.API](https://github.com/DamienDennehy/Imgur.API).

## Imgur.API
Imgur.API is a .NET implementation of Imgur's API. 

It supports Imgur's free and Mashape's commercial API endpoints.

## Current State
Lots of things I can improve on this at the moment, this was a quick fork then back port so I could use it on my personal website where I am limited to using .NET 4.0.
